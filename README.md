A tool to send the facility map to newcomers in a group
=======================================================

This tool listens to a W3C webhook and sends emails to 
new participants in a Working/Interest Group when they join.

Groups can have a customized welcome message sent automatically, by adding their template to this repository 'template' subdirectory. 
Use your group's TYPE/SHORTNAME as file name, otherwise the 'default' template will be used instead.
Team contacts and chairs will be Cc'd.

__no message is sent to Community/Business Groups new participants by default__, but if the system finds a customized message for a CG/BG, it will be sent and chairs of the CG/BG will be Cc'd.

Templates may use the Twig language to include some group data to customize your message.
The syntax is using a double curly bracket and refer to W3C group data, e.g.:

`{{ group.name }}`  will be replaced by your group's name  
`{{ group.id }}`  will be replaced by the W3C identifier for your group

Of course you may use completely basic URLs without any Twig code at all!

Available group information comes from the [W3C API](https://api.w3.org/doc) see: https://api.w3.org/groups, so you can use
*id, name, description, shortname, type, start-date, end-date.*
It should also be possible to include links like  
`{{ group._links.homepage.href }}`  
(this will render as `https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/{{ group.shortname }}` )  

or  
`{{ group._links.pp-status.href }}`   
(equivalent to `https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/{{ group.id }}/status`)
