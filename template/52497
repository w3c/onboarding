Welcome to the W3C Privacy Interest Group, known as PING.

We are delighted to have you join us. Our mission is to improve privacy on the Web.

Our co-chairs are Pete Snyder (Brave), Christine Runnegar (invited expert), and Nick Doty (CDT).  Sam Weiler is our W3C contact.

A couple of items of information that may be helpful.

* You have been subscribed to the public W3C privacy activity email list, used by PING, public-privacy@w3.org. We will invite you to the PING Slack workspace. Please look for a separate email.

* We meet the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month at noon US Eastern, 9AM Pacific (1600 or 1700 UTC depending on the season).
