Welcome to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)!

Please see general information about participating in EOWG at:
     https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/EOWG_Participation_Info
-- and let us know what questions you have.

If you plan to be active in EOWG:
* It would be good for us to have a short phone call for orientation. Let us know some times when you would be available. We are in US Central time zone and can meet outside of normal business hours if needed.
* We encourage you to send an e-mail to the group (to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org) with a brief introduction of yourself and your interest in web accessibility. Some examples are below [1]. Remember that the EOWG e-mail list is *publicly archived* so whatever you send there is available for anyone to find.

You are now subscribed to the EOWG mailing list. You can look through the archives to see past messages at: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/

We look forward to your participation in EOWG!

Please feel free to ask *any* questions you have.

Best Regards,
~Shawn Henry, EOWG W3C Team Contact
