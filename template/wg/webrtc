Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}!

The Working Group does most of its work on
Github, with each of our specifications developed in its own repository
(as listed in https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webrtc/tools).

If you plan to contribute changes to the specifications by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts

In addition, the Working Group uses its public mailing lists for
administrative announcements and coordination on topics which require
broader attention:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webrtc/
As a participant to the Working Group, you have been automatically
subscribed to that mailing list.

The group meets in video conferences roughly on a monthly basis; the
exact date and times are determined based on Doodle polls we run a few
weeks in advance of the said call.

The current focus of the Working Group is on finalizing its work on Media 
Capture and Streams https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html
and launching in earnest its work on the various components of WebRTC NV 
https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-nv-use-cases/ , including the WebRTC Encoded Transform API and improvements to the Screen Capture APIs.

The Working Group operates according to the work mode documented at:
  https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-charter/blob/gh-pages/workmode.md

Everyone who is involved in the {{ group.name }} is expected to behave in accordance with the W3C Code of Conduct:
