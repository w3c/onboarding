Welcome to the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group!

We are delighted to have you join us. Our mission is two-fold. First, we will maintain the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) specification and related Working Group Notes. Second, we will seek consensus around the best way to achieve effective interoperability through common requirements, algorithms, architectural options, and various considerations for the DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing processes.

Our co-chairs are Daniel Burnett (Invited Expert) and Gabe Cohen (Block, Inc). The staff contact is Pierre-Antoine Champin.
