Hello - welcome to the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group!

This email provides a little information and some links to help you get
started.  

You should have received a separate automated email which includes a
link to the charter. That outlines the work we have in scope at the
moment.

The Working Group maintains a wiki. The main page lists the links to
our work areas. This is a useful page to bookmark and check:
  https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Main_Page

There is also a page that provides some onboarding training materials:
  https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Onboarding_for_working_in_Github

You should start receiving emails from the WCAG list. This can have
quite a lot of traffic – we would advise setting up a folder that it
gets filtered into (email address is: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org).

The key emails to keep an eye out for are the weekly agenda emails, the
subject lines are in a standard format: AGENDA - AGWG Meeting [Date]

You can view all the archive emails at:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/

Are you joining primarily for a task force? If so, please let us know which
task force(s) you wish to join.

You may subscribe to the Group calendar at:
 https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/calendar/

Note that we use IRC quite heavily during meetings (e.g. to share links and
make notes which turn into minutes), that can be accessed at:
  http://webirc.w3.org/

With your ‘nickname’, and channel: #ag (including the hash symbol). A brief
introduction to IRC is at:
  https://www.w3.org/wiki/IRC

Other links can be found from the overview page:
  https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/

If and when you do join a call, it is customary for new members of the
group to give a quick introduction. E.g. “I’m [name], I work for [company]
doing [role], and I’m joining because I’m interested in…”  Put a comment in
IRC at the start to let the chair know you are in the meeting and wish to
introduce yourself.

If you need accessibility accommodations to participate in the work, please
let us know, with enough lead time to implement them.


All participants are required to follow the W3C Code of Conduct:
  https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/

If you are joining as an Invited Expert, note that your status depends on 
ongoing active participation in the group. If you become inactive for 
6 months or more, your Invited Expert status may not be extended. 

Should you have any questions on how to get up to speed with the
Group, please get in touch with the chairs and staff contacts by email to
  group-ag-chairs@w3.org.
