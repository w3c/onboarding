# Onboarding Documentation
  https://github.com/w3c/aria/blob/main/documentation/onboarding.md
is a complete map of useful resources for new participants in this group.

# GitHub
The Working Group does most of its work on the ARIA GitHub monorepo
  https://www.github.com/w3c/aria/

Issues for child specs are handled in their original repositories (as listed in https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/tools/ ).

If you plan to contribute changes to the specifications by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts
  
and ask Daniel Montalvo <dmontalvo@w3.org> to add you to the relevant ARIA Teams on GitHub.

# Public Mailing List
In addition, the Working Group uses its public mailing lists for
administrative announcements and coordination on topics which require
broader attention:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria/
As a participant to the Working Group, you have been automatically
subscribed to that mailing list.

# W3C Code of Conduct
