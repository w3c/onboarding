Welcome to the W3C Data Shapes Working Group!

Our mission is to update the SHACL recommendation in line with newer versions
of core Semantic Web standards and to extend the applications of Data Shapes 
with new specifications.
  
Our co-chairs are Nick Car (KurrawongAI) and Eliana Papoutsoglou (Taxonic).
Our staff contact is Carine Bournez.
