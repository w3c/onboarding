Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}!

As with all W3C work, the W3C Code of Conduct applies to everything we do
 https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/

Please could you send a short introduction to the member-tt@w3.org mailing list, both to let other members know about you, and to verify that you can send messages to that (member only) list?

The Working Group does most of its work on
Github, with each of our specifications developed in its own repository
(as listed in https://www.w3.org/groups/{{ shorttype }}/{{ group.shortname }}/tools/).

If you plan to contribute changes to the specifications by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts

In addition, the Working Group uses its public mailing lists for
administrative announcements and coordination on topics which require
broader attention:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/
As a participant to the Working Group, you have been automatically
subscribed to that mailing list.

The group meets in audio conferences roughly on a weekly basis, usually
for one hour beginning at 1600 UTC (this time is usually adjusted during
DST to 1500 UTC, but the date of the switch is discussed before each
change).

The weekly teleconference meeting agenda is published by email to the
public reflector and worked on as a GitHub issue. Upcoming meetings
have issues labelled as Agenda and can be found at:
  https://github.com/w3c/ttwg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aagenda

The group usually meets face-to-face once or twice a year, but given the
current (COVID-19) circumstances, it is not clear when we might next meet F2F.

During meetings, the group uses IRC to scribe and manage the speaker queue.
An IRC webpage is provided with the agenda; you may also find it helpful
to use a dedicated IRC client.

A timeline of specifications currently being worked on is available at:
  https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/wip/TTWG-spec-timeline.html

The group sometimes uses a wiki for managing documents such as
implementation reports, registries, and ideas. This can be found at:
  https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText

{{ group._links.homepage.href }} is also a useful resource.

Should you have any question on how to get back up to speed with the
Working Group, please get in touch with the Staff Contact of the group:
Atsushi Shimono <atsushi@w3.org>

Again, warm welcome to the group and to W3C!

Gary Katsevman and Nigel Megitt, Chairs
