# Meeting Information 
The main group meets in video conferences weekly on Thursdays at 1PM Eastern, and the ARIA Practices task force meets at 2PM Eastern on Tuesdays every other week.
You can find more details at https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/communication

The group usually meets face-to-face once or twice a year, but given the
current circumstances, it is not clear when we might next meet F2F.

# Onboarding Documentation
  https://github.com/w3c/aria/wiki/Onboaring
is a complete map of useful resources for new participants in this group.

# Github
The Working Group does most of its work on
Github, with each of our specifications developed in its own repository
(as listed in https://www.w3.org/PM/Groups/repositories.html?gid={{ group.id }}).

If you plan to contribute changes to the specifications by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts

# Public Mailing List
In addition, the Working Group uses its public mailing lists for
administrative announcements and coordination on topics which require
broader attention:
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria/
As a participant to the Working Group, you have been automatically
subscribed to that mailing list.

# W3C Code of Conduct
