Hello,

Welcome to the Web Incubator Community Group, known as WICG.

Please read this email carefully. It'll only take a minute, and it'll
help make sure you find WICG a cheerfully productive place to be.

Everyone who is involved in WICG is expected to behave in accordance
with the W3C Code of Conduct
  https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/

Links to proposed specifications being incubated in WICG and their
repositories can be found on our homepage:
https://wicg.io/

Information about proposing ideas for incubation can be found on our
Proposals repo:
https://github.com/WICG/proposals

If there's a proposed specification you're interested in working on
(and you're not already doing so), let us know and we'll help you get
started.

If you have questions or concerns, you can reach the WICG chairs and
team on wicg-team@w3.org.

Chris Wilson, Yoav Weiss, and Limin Zhu - WICG Co-Chairs
