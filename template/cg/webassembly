Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}!

The Community Group is the primary place for standardization activity for WebAssembly.

We work primarily on GitHub. See for example
the meetings, design, and spec repositories
at https://github.com/WebAssembly.
Each proposal also gets its own repository, and most of the activity happens in these
repositories.

If you plan to contribute changes to the specification or proposals by providing
pull requests, please link your Github and W3C accounts at:
  https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts


The full group meets in video conferences biweekly. The usual schedule
(as well as information for joining the VC) can be found at
https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webassembly/calendar
but there is also a Google Calendar event that is guaranteed to be
updated e.g. in the event of cancellation. Contact the chairs to be
added to it.
The agenda and notes are kept on GitHub at
https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/tree/main/main
There are also several subgroups that maintain their own meeting
schedule and agenda. A list is maintained at
https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/subgroups.md

You can find a list of community-driven WebAssembly resources
(including our very active Discord server) at
https://webassembly.org/community/resources/

If you have questions or need help, you can contact the CG chairs at
webassembly-cg-chair@chromium.org

Again, warm welcome to the group and to W3C!
