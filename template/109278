Welcome to the W3C {{ group.name }}, known as PWE!
 
The Positive Work Environment Community Group has merged with the Inclusiveness and Diversity CG. We are an informal place where everyone is welcome to share their ideas, to pitch in and work, to provide different perspectives, or simply to listen. We strive to make the W3C a more positive, welcoming, inclusive, and diverse environment.
 
Everyone who is involved in PWE is expected to behave in accordance with the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC):

We have a regular call on alternating Tuesdays at 1400 UTC. Details for the call are sent to the PWE email list before the meeting.
 
We're working on different action items and issues in two GitHub repositories at
https://github.com/w3c/PWETF and https://github.com/w3c/idcg. Please join us on the W3C's Slack at https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/archives/C01GHJ5L6T1.
 
We have two email lists that you've been added to automatically: public-pwe@w3.org and internal-pwe@w3.org. The first is where most of our discussions (other than those on Github) happen, the second is for discussions that we want to keep just between members of the CG.
 
If you have any questions, you are welcome to contact Tzviya, Léonie, or Liz at any time.
 
Tzviya, Liz, and Léonie, PWE CG co-chairs.
