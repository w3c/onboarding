If there's a proposed specification you're interested in working on (and you're not already doing so), let us know and we'll help you get started.

If you have questions or concerns, you can reach the WICG chairs and team on wicg-team@w3.org.

Chris Wilson, Travis Leighthead, Yoav Weiss, and Léonie Watson - WICG Co-Chairs.
