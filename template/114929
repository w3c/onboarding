Welcome to the {{ group.name }} (WG), known simply as WebApps.

Please read this email carefully. It'll only take a minute, and it'll help make sure you find the {{ group.name }} a cheerfully productive place to be.

Everyone who is involved in the {{ group.name }} is expected to behave in accordance with the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CEPC):
  https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/

You'll find information about each of the {{ group.name }} specifications, including links to their Github repositories, on the {{ group.name }} homepage:
https://w3c.github.io/webappswg/

Please note: the specification information is a work in progress. As each specification publishes its first Working Draft as part of the {{ group.name }}, it will be added automatically to the homepage. 

If there is a specification you're interested in working on (and you're not already doing so), let us know and we'll help you get started.

We raise and discuss issues relating to {{ group.name }} itself on the WG repository:
https://github.com/w3c/webappswg/

We also have a public email (which you've been subscribed to automatically), but we don't use it very much.

We don't hold regular conference calls, but we do have an IRC channel for general discussions: #WebApps available on irc.w3.org:6667. We also have a WebApps channel in the W3C Slack.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach the {{ group.name }} chairs and team contacts directly on team-webapps@w3.org.

Léonie Watson and Marcos Cáceres ({{ group.name }} co-chairs)
